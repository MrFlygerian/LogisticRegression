This is a simple instance of logisitc regression used to a) make a particular decision, i.e. who does or does not get a discount based on the user spend and b) predict some class based on some input, in this case the class is gender based on the users' input height and weight.

The error analysis is simply the accuracy of the prediction printed out alongisde the prediction of the gender.

Running this file is trivial and only requires the dataset provides with it (loaded into the same directory).
The tutorial for making this script came from a towardsdatascience article by   Gustavo Chaves. The URL is at the bottom of this file.
